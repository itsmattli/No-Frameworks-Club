###Assumptions
#####Part 4
- Rank is based on other users' scores with the same leaderboardId
#####Part 6/7
- Each data_key is referring to a direct child of the "Data" node
    
###Things to do with more time
- Create a api client (possibly through swagger)
- Looked at alternate ways to do routing
- Create one configuration file with all settings and keys
- Do more validation checks (especially for improper POST bodies)
- Integrate PHPUnit and Travis-CI (if Frameworks were allowed)
- Would have investigated using PDO instead of mysqli
    
###Extra
- [Postman Collection and Documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/1994094/collection/7Ln9MzC)
- .sql files for the database are included in /data
